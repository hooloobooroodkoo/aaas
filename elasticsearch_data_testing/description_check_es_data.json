    "description": "This code checks whether expected hosts are found in the Elasticsearch meta data. It is executed daily and takes a list of expected hosts as input. The function queries Elasticsearch for meta data and compares it with the list of expected hosts. It reports hosts that are not found in Elasticsearch, as well as hosts that are found but not mentioned in the provided configurations in such way reporting all the discovered discrepancies. This process is crucial for ensuring that all the relevant information about hosts' testing is saved correctly in the database. The code can be found here: [https://github.com/hooloobooroodkoo/aaas/blob/main/check_es_meta.py].",
    "template": "The following hosts were not found in Elasticsearch:\n%{missing_hosts}\nThe following hosts were found in Elasticsearch but not mentioned in configurations:\n%{found_hosts}\nPlease review the host configurations accordingly."
