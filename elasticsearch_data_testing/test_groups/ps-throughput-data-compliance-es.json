    "description": "This code checks whether the throughput data for expected hosts are found in the Elasticsearch. It is executed daily and takes a list of expected hosts as input. The function queries Elasticsearch for throughput data and compares it with the list of expected hosts. It reports hosts that are mentioned in the configurations but can not be found in Elasticsearch. This process is crucial for ensuring that all the relevant information about hosts' testing is saved correctly in the database. The code can be found here: [..].",
