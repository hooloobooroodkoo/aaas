    "description": "This code checks whether unexpected hosts are found in the Elasticsearch meta data. It is executed daily and takes a list of expected hosts as input. The function queries Elasticsearch for meta data and compares it with the list of expected hosts. It reports hosts that are found but not mentioned in the provided configurations in such way reporting all the discovered discrepancies. This process is crucial for ensuring that all the relevant information about hosts' testing is saved correctly in the database. The code can be found here: [https://github.com/hooloobooroodkoo/aaas/blob/main/elasticsearch_data_testing/ps-meta-hosts-tests-data-compliance.py].",
